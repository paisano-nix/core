      Everything under ''${cellsFrom}/* is considered a Cell

      only directories are allowed at ''${cellsFrom}/*

      Please remove ${"'"}''${cellsFrom}/${cell}' and don't forget to add the change to version control.

      For Cell '${cell}' to be useful
      it needs to provide at least one Cell Block

      In this project, the Cell Blocks can be
      ${l.concatStringsSep ", " (l.map (o: o.name) cellBlocks)}


      ${
        l.concatStringsSep "\n\n" (
          l.map (

          )

      Please create at least one of the previous files and don't forget to add them to version control.
